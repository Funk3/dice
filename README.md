Welcome to dice!

This is a simple dice rolling app using react-native and built for iOS. You click on the dice and it rolls a random number for you.

Currently has to be built on your own computer, with the instructions [here](https://github.com/Funk3/dice/blob/main/Instructions.md). May consider being able to sideload via testflight if there's enough interest.
